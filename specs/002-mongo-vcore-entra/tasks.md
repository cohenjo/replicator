# Tasks: Azure Entra Authentication for MongoDB Cosmos DB

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-mongo-vcore-entra/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Found: Go 1.25+ with MongoDB driver and Azure SDK
   → Extract: pkg/auth, pkg/position, pkg/streams, pkg/estuary libraries
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: MongoConfig, EntraAuthConfig, OIDCCredentialProvider entities
   → contracts/: mongodb-entra-auth.md, configuration-schema.md
   → research.md: MONGO-OIDC implementation pattern, token lifecycle
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Go dependencies, test infrastructure, linting
   → Tests: contract tests for interfaces, integration tests for auth flow
   → Core: auth provider, config extensions, MongoDB client enhancement
   → Integration: position tracker, streams, estuary endpoint updates
   → Polish: CLI validation, metrics, unit tests
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validated: All contracts have tests, all entities have tasks
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `pkg/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths reference existing replicator structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Check mongo-driver version and upgrade to v2 if needed for MONGODB-OIDC support
- [ ] T002 Add Azure SDK dependencies to go.mod for Entra authentication support
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure golangci-lint rules for auth package enhancements
- [ ] T004 [P] Set up testcontainers infrastructure for MongoDB OIDC testing

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test MONGODB-OIDC credential callback in pkg/auth/mongo_client_test.go
- [ ] T006 [P] Contract test shared MongoClient creation with Entra auth in pkg/auth/mongo_client_test.go
- [ ] T007 [P] Contract test enhanced MongoConfig validation with scope validation in pkg/position/mongo_tracker_test.go
- [ ] T008 [P] Integration test complete Entra auth flow with token refresh in tests/integration/entra_auth_flow_test.go
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test token expiry and forced invalidation scenarios in tests/integration/token_lifecycle_test.go
- [ ] T010 [P] Test injectable time source for token expiry testing in tests/integration/token_expiry_test.go

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T011 Add MongoDB scopes to existing AzureEntraConfig.Scopes with default ["https://cosmos.azure.com/.default"]
- [ ] T012 [P] Create shared NewMongoClientWithAuth function in pkg/auth/mongo_client.go
- [ ] T013 [P] Implement MONGODB-OIDC credential callback with singleflight concurrency control in pkg/auth/mongo_client.go
- [ ] T014 Add auth_method, tenant_id, client_id, scopes, refresh_before_expiry fields to MongoConfig in pkg/position/mongo_tracker.go
- [ ] T015 Update existing NewMongoTracker to use shared auth client in pkg/position/mongo_tracker.go
- [ ] T016 Add minimal Entra auth fields (mongo_auth_method, mongo_tenant_id, mongo_client_id, mongo_scopes) to WaterFlowsConfig in pkg/config/config.go
- [ ] T017 Update existing NewMongoEndpoint to use shared auth client in pkg/estuary/mongo.go
- [ ] T018 Update existing MongoDBStream to use shared auth client in pkg/streams/mongodb_stream.go

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T019 Add authentication method and scope validation to MongoConfig.Validate in pkg/position/mongo_tracker.go
- [ ] T020 Add token refresh handling with configurable buffer to shared mongo client in pkg/auth/mongo_client.go
- [ ] T021 Add authentication retry logic with exponential backoff in pkg/auth/mongo_client.go
- [ ] T022 Integrate auth metrics (replicator_mongo_auth_*, replicator_mongo_token_*) into existing AzureEntraProvider in pkg/auth/azure_entra.go
- [ ] T023 Add structured logging with correlation IDs for auth events in pkg/auth/mongo_client.go

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T024 [P] Add CLI --test-auth flag for authentication validation in cmd/replicator/main.go
- [ ] T025 [P] Unit tests for MONGODB-OIDC callback and concurrency scenarios in pkg/auth/mongo_client_test.go
- [ ] T026 [P] Unit tests for config validation with scope verification in pkg/position/mongo_tracker_test.go
- [ ] T027 [P] Performance test for auth latency (<200ms) in tests/performance/auth_performance_test.go
- [ ] T028 [P] Update examples with Entra config and migration guide in examples/configs/azure/
- [ ] T029 [P] Update README.md with Entra authentication section
- [ ] T030 [P] Update CHANGELOG.md with v1.2.0 release notes
- [ ] T031 Verify backward compatibility with existing connection strings
- [ ] T032 Run quickstart validation scenarios

## Dependencies
- Driver check (T001) before all other tasks
- Tests (T005-T010) before implementation (T011-T018)
- T011 (AzureEntraConfig extension) blocks T012, T013
- T012 (shared MongoClient) blocks T015, T017, T018
- T014 (MongoConfig extension) blocks T015, T019
- T016 (WaterFlowsConfig) blocks T017
- Implementation (T011-T018) before integration (T019-T023)
- All core tasks before polish (T024-T032)

## Parallel Execution Examples
```bash
# Phase 3.2: Tests (independent _test.go files)
Task: "Contract test MONGODB-OIDC credential callback in pkg/auth/mongo_client_test.go"
Task: "Contract test shared MongoClient creation in pkg/auth/mongo_client_test.go"
Task: "Contract test enhanced MongoConfig validation in pkg/position/mongo_tracker_test.go"

# Phase 3.3: Core (different packages/files)
Task: "Add MongoDB scopes to existing AzureEntraConfig in pkg/auth/models.go"
Task: "Create shared NewMongoClientWithAuth in pkg/auth/mongo_client.go"
Task: "Add auth_method field to MongoConfig in pkg/position/mongo_tracker.go"

# Phase 3.5: Polish (independent files)
Task: "Add CLI --test-auth flag in cmd/replicator/main.go"
Task: "Unit tests for MONGODB-OIDC callback in pkg/auth/mongo_client_test.go"
Task: "Update examples in examples/configs/azure/"
```

## Critical Fixes Applied
- **Auth mechanism**: Standardized to "MONGODB-OIDC" (not "OIDC")
- **Driver version**: Added explicit check for mongo-driver v2 requirement
- **Scope validation**: Enforce `https://cosmos.azure.com/.default`, prevent wrong scopes
- **Config schema**: Single flat structure (tenant_id, client_id in root config, not nested)
- **No duplication**: Remove EntraAuthConfig, extend existing AzureEntraConfig only
- **Metrics naming**: Use `replicator_mongo_*` pattern matching existing conventions
- **Concurrency**: Singleflight pattern for GetToken to prevent token request stampede
- **Token lifecycle**: Configurable refresh_before_expiry (default: 5m)
- **Observability**: Correlation IDs, comprehensive metrics including cache hits/misses

## Notes
- **Minimal Changes**: Extend existing structs rather than create new ones
- **Code Reuse**: Single shared MongoClient creation function
- **Go Conventions**: Tests in `*_test.go` files alongside source code
- **Driver Version**: Verify v2 support for MONGODB-OIDC, upgrade only if needed
- **Scope Security**: Validate against common mistakes (PostgreSQL/MySQL scopes)
- All tests must fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Focus on extending existing functionality rather than creating parallel systems

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - mongodb-entra-auth.md → T005-T006 (MONGODB-OIDC callback and shared client tests)
   - configuration-schema.md → T007 (config validation with scope verification)
   
2. **From Data Model** (Minimal Extensions):
   - MongoConfig (Extended) → T014-T015 (flat schema with validation)
   - Shared MongoClient → T012-T013 (single reusable component with concurrency control)
   - AzureEntraConfig (Extended) → T011 (extend existing, add MongoDB scopes)
   
3. **From User Stories** (Enhanced with observability):
   - Authentication flow → T008 (integration test with refresh)
   - Token lifecycle → T009-T010 (expiry, invalidation, injectable time)

4. **Critical Accuracy Fixes**:
   - Driver version check → T001 (verify v2 for MONGODB-OIDC support)
   - Scope validation → T019 (prevent PostgreSQL/MySQL scope mistakes)
   - Metrics alignment → T022 (replicator_mongo_* naming pattern)
   - Concurrency control → T013 (singleflight for token requests)

5. **Code Reuse Strategy**:
   - Single shared MongoClient creation function (T012)
   - Extend existing AzureEntraConfig instead of new struct (T011)
   - Flat configuration schema (no nested auth_config) (T014)
   - Comprehensive observability with correlation IDs (T022-T023)
