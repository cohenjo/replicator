# Feature Specification: Azure Entra Authentication for MongoDB Cosmos DB

**Feature Branch**: `002-mongo-vcore-entra`  
**Created**: September 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "mongo-vcore-entra-auth - I want to add support for azure entra authentication for mongo running on Azure Cosmos. our mongo stream and estaury now only support connection string connections. We want to add Entra support. A user should be able to define the URI/endpoint of the mongo cluster, and configure replicator to use workload identity."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants Azure Entra authentication for MongoDB on Cosmos DB
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: replicator administrators, Azure workload identity
   ‚Üí Actions: authenticate, connect, replicate data
   ‚Üí Data: MongoDB connection configuration, Azure credentials
   ‚Üí Constraints: must work with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Authentication method: Azure Entra with workload identity specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User configures endpoint and workload identity for secure connections
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on authentication capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Connection configurations, authentication contexts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on user needs, avoids implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a replicator administrator managing MongoDB data replication from Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, I want to authenticate using Azure Entra (workload identity) instead of connection strings so that I can:
- Leverage Azure's managed identity security model
- Avoid storing sensitive credentials in configuration files
- Benefit from Azure's credential rotation and access management
- Comply with enterprise security policies that prohibit hardcoded credentials

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a replicator instance with workload identity configured and a MongoDB Cosmos DB vCore cluster with Entra authentication enabled, **When** I configure the replicator with the MongoDB endpoint URI and specify Entra authentication, **Then** the replicator successfully authenticates and establishes a connection to replicate data

2. **Given** a properly configured Entra-authenticated MongoDB connection, **When** the replicator attempts to read from or write to the MongoDB cluster, **Then** all database operations complete successfully using the Entra-provided credentials

3. **Given** an existing replicator configuration using connection strings, **When** I migrate to Entra authentication by updating the configuration, **Then** the replicator continues operating without data loss or service interruption

4. **Given** incorrect workload identity configuration or insufficient permissions, **When** the replicator attempts to connect using Entra authentication, **Then** the system provides clear error messages indicating the authentication failure and suggested remediation steps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Azure Entra token expires during a long-running replication operation?
- How does the system handle temporary Azure authentication service outages?
- What occurs when workload identity permissions are revoked while replication is in progress?
- How does the system behave when the MongoDB Cosmos DB cluster is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support Azure Entra authentication for MongoDB connections to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore clusters
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to configure MongoDB endpoint URI separately from authentication credentials
- **FR-003**: System MUST support Azure workload identity as the authentication mechanism for Entra-enabled connections
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically handle Azure Entra token acquisition and renewal without user intervention
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain existing connection string authentication support for backward compatibility
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear configuration options to choose between connection string and Entra authentication methods
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate Entra authentication configuration at startup and provide meaningful error messages for misconfigurations
- **FR-008**: System MUST support both source and target MongoDB connections using Entra authentication
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle authentication failures gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms
- **FR-010**: System MUST log authentication events for security auditing purposes while protecting sensitive credential information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MongoDB Connection Configuration**: Represents connection settings including endpoint URI, authentication method selection, and method-specific parameters
- **Azure Entra Authentication Context**: Represents workload identity configuration and token management state for Azure authentication
- **Authentication Method**: Represents the choice between connection string and Entra authentication, with validation rules for each method
