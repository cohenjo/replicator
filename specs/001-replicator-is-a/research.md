# Research: Database Replication System with Change Streams

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Go 1.25 Upgrade
**Decision**: Upgrade from current Go version to Go 1.25  
**Rationale**: 
- Performance improvements in garbage collector and compiler
- Enhanced security features and vulnerability management
- Better support for modern container environments
- Improved observability integration capabilities
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Stay with current Go version (rejected due to missing features)
- Migrate to other languages (rejected due to existing codebase investment)

### Container and Orchestration
**Decision**: Docker containers deployed on Kubernetes  
**Rationale**:
- Standardized deployment across environments
- Auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Resource management and monitoring integration
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct deployment (rejected due to operational complexity)
- Other orchestrators (rejected due to ecosystem maturity)

### Authentication - Azure Entra ID
**Decision**: Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) integration  
**Rationale**:
- Enterprise identity integration
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Seamless integration with Azure services
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom authentication (rejected due to security complexity)
- Other cloud providers (rejected due to Azure ecosystem focus)

### Database Support - Cosmos DB MongoDB API
**Decision**: Support both Cosmos DB vCore and RU MongoDB APIs  
**Rationale**:
- vCore: Better compatibility with MongoDB features and tooling
- RU: Cost-effective for smaller workloads with predictable patterns
- Unified MongoDB driver can support both with connection string differences
**Alternatives considered**:
- Support only one Cosmos DB offering (rejected due to customer requirements)
- Native Cosmos DB SQL API (rejected due to MongoDB ecosystem preference)

### Metrics and Observability - OpenTelemetry
**Decision**: OpenTelemetry for metrics, traces, and logs  
**Rationale**:
- Vendor-neutral observability standard
- Rich ecosystem of exporters and backends
- Unified approach to telemetry data
- Future-proof and standardized
**Alternatives considered**:
- Prometheus only (rejected due to limited tracing capabilities)
- Vendor-specific solutions (rejected due to lock-in concerns)

### Structured Logging - JSON Format
**Decision**: JSON structured logging with contextual fields  
**Rationale**:
- Machine-readable format for log aggregation
- Consistent structure across services
- Better integration with observability platforms
- Correlation ID support for distributed tracing
**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain text logging (rejected due to parsing complexity)
- Binary logging formats (rejected due to debugging complexity)

## Architecture Patterns

### Change Stream Abstraction
**Decision**: Generic change stream interface with database-specific implementations  
**Rationale**:
- Extensible to new database types
- Consistent event format across sources
- Simplified testing and mocking capabilities
**Implementation approach**:
- Interface-based design with factory pattern
- Event normalization layer
- Position tracking abstraction

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: YAML configuration files with validation and hot-reload  
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable and version-controllable
- Rich validation capabilities
- Support for environment variable substitution
- Hot-reload for operational flexibility
**Schema requirements**:
- Stream definitions with source/destination pairs
- Transformation rule specifications
- Authentication configuration
- Service operational parameters

### Transformation Engine
**Decision**: Extend existing Kazaam library with custom functions  
**Rationale**:
- Proven JSON transformation library
- Extensible with custom transformation functions
- Good performance characteristics
- Familiar to existing codebase
**Enhancement areas**:
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Schema validation capabilities

### Position Tracking and Recovery
**Decision**: Persistent position storage with atomic updates  
**Rationale**:
- Guarantees exactly-once processing semantics
- Enables recovery from arbitrary points
- Supports multiple concurrent streams
**Implementation approach**:
- Database-agnostic position storage
- Atomic commit of position updates
- Checkpoint-based recovery mechanisms

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

### Throughput Targets
**Research findings**: 
- Modern change stream implementations can handle 10k+ events/sec
- Network and serialization often bottlenecks, not processing
- Batch processing can improve throughput significantly

### Memory Management
**Research findings**:
- Go's garbage collector improvements in 1.25 reduce pause times
- Memory pooling for event objects reduces allocation pressure
- Streaming processing patterns minimize memory footprint

### Kubernetes Resource Management
**Research findings**:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can scale based on custom metrics
- Resource requests/limits should account for burst patterns
- Persistent volumes needed for position tracking state

## Security Considerations

### Azure Entra Integration Patterns
**Research findings**:
- Service Principal authentication recommended for service-to-service
- Managed Identity preferred when running in Azure
- Token caching and refresh patterns for long-running services

### Database Connection Security
**Research findings**:
- Connection string encryption at rest
- TLS enforcement for all database connections
- Credential rotation strategies for operational security

### Container Security
**Research findings**:
- Non-root user execution in containers
- Minimal base images to reduce attack surface
- Regular vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Testing Strategy Research

### Integration Testing with Real Databases
**Research findings**:
- Testcontainers provides excellent database isolation
- Docker-in-Docker patterns for CI/CD environments
- Performance testing requires realistic data volumes

### Contract Testing Approaches
**Research findings**:
- OpenAPI specification generation from code
- Consumer-driven contract testing for downstream services
- Schema evolution testing for backward compatibility

### Load Testing Considerations
**Research findings**:
- Gradual ramp-up patterns mirror real-world usage
- Metrics collection during load tests essential
- Database-specific load patterns for realistic testing
