# Feature Specification: Database Replication System with Change Streams

**Feature Branch**: `001-replicator-is-a`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "replicator is a replication project utilizing change streams to track database changes and replicate them to a distination database. users can define stream sources and estuary with optional transformation to events. The replication position is tracked to ensure that replication will not miss events and continue from the same event in case of failure. metrics allow users to track the replication rate, performance, errors , number of events etc. replicator aims to be as generic as possible to allow easily adding new databases and authentication methods."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: database replication, change streams, transformation, metrics
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users/administrators, data engineers
   ‚Üí Actions: define sources, replicate data, transform events, monitor metrics
   ‚Üí Data: database changes, replication positions, metrics
   ‚Üí Constraints: no missed events, failure recovery, generic design
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All key aspects sufficiently defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: configure ‚Üí replicate ‚Üí monitor
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Stream sources, destinations, events, positions, metrics
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focused on business needs, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Data engineers and database administrators need to replicate data changes from source databases to destination databases in real-time. They configure replication streams through configuration files, deploy the replicator as a backend service with database access, and monitor the autonomous replication process to ensure data consistency and system reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a configuration file defining source and destination databases, **When** the replicator service is deployed and started, **Then** all subsequent changes are replicated to the destination in real-time without manual intervention
2. **Given** an active replication service, **When** the replication process fails or is interrupted, **Then** the system automatically resumes replication from the exact point where it stopped without losing any events
3. **Given** a configuration file with transformation rules, **When** data changes occur in the source database, **Then** the data is transformed according to the rules before being written to the destination
4. **Given** a running replication service, **When** monitoring systems query the metrics endpoints, **Then** they receive real-time replication rate, error counts, event counts, and performance metrics
5. **Given** a configuration file specifying multiple database types as sources and destinations, **When** the replicator service processes the configuration, **Then** the system supports replication regardless of database type combinations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the destination database is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle transformation errors for specific events?
- What occurs when the source database schema changes during replication?
- How does the system behave when replication lag becomes significant?
- What happens when multiple replication streams compete for system resources?
- How does the service handle configuration file corruption or invalid syntax?
- What occurs when database access credentials become invalid during operation?
- How does the system respond when configuration files are updated while the service is running?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-012**: System MUST handle transformation errors gracefully without stopping replication
- **FR-013**: System MUST load and validate configuration files defining replication streams
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate configuration file contents before starting replication services
- **FR-015**: System MUST support concurrent replication streams without interference
- **FR-016**: System MUST operate as an autonomous backend service without requiring manual intervention
- **FR-017**: System MUST be deployable with pre-configured access to both source and destination databases
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide monitoring endpoints for external monitoring systems to query metrics
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle configuration file changes by reloading and applying new settings

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration File**: Contains replication stream definitions, source and destination database connections, transformation rules, and service settings
- **Stream Source**: Represents a source database being monitored for changes, defined in configuration with connection details and change stream configuration
- **Estuary (Destination)**: Represents a destination database where replicated data is written, defined in configuration with connection and write settings
- **Replication Event**: Individual database change captured from source, contains change data and metadata
- **Replication Position**: Tracking marker indicating the last successfully processed event, enables resumption capability
- **Transformation Rule**: Optional data modification logic defined in configuration and applied to events during replication
- **Replication Stream**: Complete configuration linking source to destination with optional transformation, defined in configuration file
- **Metrics Data**: Performance and operational statistics including rates, counts, errors, and timing information, exposed through monitoring endpoints
- **Service Configuration**: Backend service settings including deployment parameters, database access credentials, and operational parameters
