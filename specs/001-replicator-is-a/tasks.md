**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-replicator-is-a/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Progress**: 46/55 tasks complete (84% done - Service Assembly Complete, Polish Phase Active)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Go 1.25, OpenTelemetry, Azure Entra, Cosmos MongoDB API
   → Libraries: streams, transform, metrics, auth, estuary
   → Structure: Single project (backend service)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 9 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Management API + Config schema → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Technology decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Go 1.25 upgrade, dependencies, Docker setup
   → Tests: 8 API contract tests, integration scenarios
   → Core: 5 libraries, 9 models, 8 endpoints
   → Integration: Databases, OpenTelemetry, Azure auth
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. SUCCESS (38 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
```
Setup (T001-T007) → Tests (T008-T021) → Models (T022-T027) → Libraries (T028-T032) → API (T033-T037)
                                      ↓
                  Database Integration (T038-T042) → Service Assembly (T043-T046) → Polish (T047-T055)
```

### Critical Path Dependencies

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files/packages, no dependencies
- ALL tests (T008-T021) must be written and FAIL before implementation
- Verify Go 1.25 compatibility throughout
- Commit after each task completion
- Focus on library-first architecture per constitutional requirements

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Management API Contract**: 8 endpoints → 8 contract tests (T008-T015)
2. **From Data Model**: 9 entities → 6 model packages (T022-T027)
3. **From Plan Libraries**: 5 libraries → 5 implementation tasks (T028-T032)
4. **From Quickstart Scenarios**: 6 integration tests (T016-T021)
5. **From Technical Context**: Setup tasks for Go 1.25, OpenTelemetry, Azure, Docker (T001-T007)

## Validation Checklist Complete ✓

- [x] All 8 API contracts have corresponding tests (T008-T015)
- [x] All 9 entities have model tasks grouped into 6 packages (T022-T027)
- [x] All tests (T008-T021) come before implementation (T022+)
- [x] Parallel tasks [P] are truly independent (different files/packages)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD order enforced: Contract → Integration → Implementation
